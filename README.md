Learning the rules of algebraic manipulation can be hard and boring for students. Here I created a game that makes the process fun and intuitive! The game consists of levels that slowly build in new concepts (such as expanding brackets and collecting like terms) and require students to drag and drop tiles to simplify expressions.

In order to make this app, I learned the Phaser library, which is an extension on Javascript. I used this library in particular for its support of nested draggable containers, which I believed would be particularly useful for nested series of algebraic brackets.

In the background is an SQL database (communicated to through jQuery) that stores each student's progress.
